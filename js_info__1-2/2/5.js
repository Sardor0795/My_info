// There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript

// Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.

/*
console.log(Infinity < 20);

So, if there’s a NaN somewhere in a mathematical expression, it propagates to the whole result (there’s only one exception to that: NaN ** 0 is 1).


In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot safely represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.
