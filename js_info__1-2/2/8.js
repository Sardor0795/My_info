operator : unary/binary

- same symbol but 2 operator


Formally, in the examples above we have two different operators that share the same symbol: the negation operator, a unary operator that reverses the sign, and the subtraction operator, a binary operator that subtracts one number from another.

Exponentiation **
straightforward


Remainder %
The remainder operator %, despite its appearance, is not related to percents.

The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.


alert( 4 ** (1/2) ); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
alert( 8 ** (1/3) ); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)
