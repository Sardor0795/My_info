Ninja code

Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.

Brevity is the soul of wit
Make the code as short as possible. Show how smart you are.


Use abbreviations
If the team rules forbid the use of one-letter and vague names – shorten them, make abbreviations.

Like this:

list → lst.
userAgent → ua.
browser → brsr.
…etc


While choosing a name try to use the most abstract word. Like obj, data, value, item, elem and so on.
The ideal name for a variable is data. Use it everywhere you can. Indeed, every variable holds data, right?

…But what to do if data is already taken? Try value, it’s also universal. After all, a variable eventually gets a value.
